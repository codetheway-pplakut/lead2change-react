Currently, the Interview page is not working as intended.
What's not working is the following:
    -When the page is reloaded, the previous answers are not appearing on load correctly as they should
    -When this does work, it does not allow you to edit the previous answers
    -Git Questions is not up-to-date with Interview Questions

These fixes may require some time to fix.
